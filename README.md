# Gnome Timezones Extension
Show multiple clocks in the panel. 

For those who need more than one additional clock, this extension makes very easy to add two, three or more clocks to the main panel area.

There is already an excellent [MultiClock](https://github.com/mibus/MultiClock) extension, but that extension only displays a second clock. What i need is to reference 3 different clocks, my local time, UTC time and Puerto Rico time. If you have the same need, this extension can help you.

## How to use

- Click on a clock to make it active.
- Click on an active clock to deactivate it.
- **Search by city, not just timezone.** Type into the filter field and it matches city names as well as timezone IDs — searching `Seattle` surfaces `America/Los_Angeles`, `Osaka` surfaces `Asia/Tokyo`, and so on. The list is drawn from world cities with a population of 500,000 or more. Matches show the city name you searched for, and adding one from a search sets that city as the clock's label automatically.
- **Rename any active clock.** Each active clock row has a pencil button — click it to type a custom label (e.g. `Home`, `Head Office`) that then shows in the panel and the menu. Submit with Enter; clear the field and press Enter to revert to the default name.
- **Reorder by drag-and-drop.** Drag the handle on the left of an active clock row to move it. While dragging, the whole row follows the pointer and a line shows where it will land; the order you choose is used in both the panel and the Active clocks menu section.
- [Configure it](#configuration) as you wish.

## Configuration

- **24 hours format**: Toggle between 24 and 12 hours format. Defaults to 24.
- **Show city name**: Controls if in the clock shows the city name before the time. Defaults to true. Custom labels set via the pencil button take the place of the city name here.
- **Show timezone**: Shows the timezone before the time and after the City name if it is shown. Defaults to false.
- **Hide system clock**: Hides GNOME Shell's own clock text in the top bar (the date/calendar button itself stays, so notifications and the calendar remain reachable). Reverts immediately when toggled off, and the system clock always returns on the lock screen. Defaults to false.
- **Show separator**: Joins the panel clocks with ` | ` instead of the default spacing. Defaults to false. Only affects the panel label, not the menu rows.
- **Clear clocks**: It will deactivate all current active clocks. In case you can't remove a clock, you can use this button to clear all clocks.

## Contributing

-   This extension is plain, unbundled GJS ESM (GNOME Shell 45+ extension format) — there is no build/bundle step. Edit `extension.js` / `timezones.js` directly.
-   Update the readme with an example if you add or change any functionality.

### Installation
```bash
$ cd ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/
$ git clone git@github.com:Masquerade-Circus/gnome-timezones-extension.git timezones@masquerade-circus.net
```

### Development

The extension has no dependencies and no `package.json`/bundler — `extension.js`, `timezones.js`, and `cityAliases.js` are loaded by GNOME Shell as-is. Active-clock reordering uses GNOME Shell's built-in `resource:///org/gnome/shell/ui/dnd.js` module (`DND.makeDraggable` on a per-row drag handle); this is a stable Shell-internal module, not a new dependency.

`cityAliases.js` (the city-name → timezone search index) is generated data, not hand-edited. Regenerate it with `tools/generate-city-aliases.py` (see `tools/README.md` for the GeoNames source and provenance). Useful commands while developing:

- `journalctl -f -o cat /usr/bin/gnome-shell`: Watch the GNOME Shell log for errors.
- `gnome-extensions enable timezones@masquerade-circus.net`: Enable the extension.
- `gnome-extensions disable timezones@masquerade-circus.net`: Disable the extension.
- `glib-compile-schemas schemas/`: Recompile the settings schema after editing `schemas/org.gnome.shell.extensions.timezones.gschema.xml`.

On X11 you can reload the shell with Alt+F2, `r`, Enter after making changes; on Wayland you must log out/in (or use a nested shell via `dbus-run-session -- gnome-shell --nested --wayland` for testing).
